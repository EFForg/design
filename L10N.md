Localization (also known as the L10N shorthand) is really important work, and EFF welcomes volunteers from all over the world to help us translate and localize various EFF projects. 

## How to Contribute
If you want to contribute to EFF's localization efforts, but aren't sure where to start, please visit [Translating with EFF](https://www.eff.org/translating-eff) and we will contact you if and when there is an opportunity that fits your profile. 

Software projects you can get involved in now include:
+ [Privacy Badger](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/master/doc/Translation.md)

## Localizing EFF Graphics
If you want to localize our graphics to better fit your context, please do so! For more information about how EFF handles crediting and our CC-BY materials, please refer to our [trademark and usage policy](https://www.eff.org/pages/trademark-and-brand-usage-policy). 

We try very hard to make our infographics easier to localize. Some principles we presently abide by for educational graphics are:
+ limiting the amount of English text used, unless it's commonly used (e.g. "https", "VPN")
+ taking advantage of external captions, so that they are separate text from the image

With a few exceptions, all our graphics are originally made with left-to-right English readers in mind. However, we'd love for them to be more useful to readers of other languages and contexts outside of the US. We'd like to use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) more often for remixing purposes, but we aren't able to do this for every project.

Depending on our capacity, we may be able to share versions of our graphics that are easier to work with: you can reach out to our intake at info@eff.org to inquire about editable versions of graphics for localization purposes.

## Localization Considerations for Designs
We're working on this presently!

Considerations we're keeping in mind:
+ layout considerations for Right-to-Left languages
+ typographic guidelines for non-English languages

## Understanding the L10N Process at EFF
EFF recognizes that itâ€™s important to offer translated content in order to reach a global audience. We treat the translation of digital security guides, written instructions, and blogposts a bit differently than our software projects. 

Localization management for guides, instructions, and blogposts is a manual process at EFF, therefore not all content on eff.org or EFF websites is translated. When a piece is translated, it's often because the content within is relevant for people who speak that particular language. 

For other written guides and instructions, like our [Surveillance Self-Defense project](https://ssd.eff.org/), we may only have the resources to host a certain number of languages, though we'd love to be able to support more! It might be the case that you don't see EFF material translated into your particular language. Here's what you can do:

+ Translate or host content on your own. Any and all original material on the EFF website may be [freely distributed](https://www.eff.org/copyright) at will under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/), unless otherwise noted. All material that is not original to EFF may require permission from the copyright holder to redistribute. We encourage those who host translations to include timestamps and links to the original text.

+ Join EFF's Cooperating Translator's mailing list, a list EFF occasionally pings with general translation requests. You can sign up for the mailing list at the botton of this [form](https://www.eff.org/translating-eff)

Thanks for your interest in supporting L10N at EFF!
