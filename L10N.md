## Understanding the L10N Process at EFF
EFF recognizes that itâ€™s important to offer translated content in order to reach a global audience. We treat the translation of digital security guides, written instructions, and blogposts a bit differently than our software projects. 

Localization management for guides, instructions, and blogposts is a manual process at EFF, therefore not all content on eff.org or EFF websites is translated. When a piece is translated, it's often because the content within is relevant for people who speak that particular language. 

For other written guides and instructions, like our [Surveillance Self-Defense project](ssd.eff.org), we may only have the resources to host a certain number of languages, though we'd love to be able to support more! It might be the case that you don't see EFF material translated into your particular language. Here's what you can do:

+ Translate or host content on your own. Any and all original material on the EFF website may be [freely distributed](https://www.eff.org/copyright) at will under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/), unless otherwise noted. All material that is not original to EFF may require permission from the copyright holder to redistribute. We encourage those who host translations to include timestamps and links to the original text.

+ Join EFF's Cooperating Translator's mailing list, a list EFF occasionally pings with general translation requests. You can sign up for the mailing list at the botton of this [form](https://www.eff.org/translating-eff)

Thanks for your interest in supporting L10N at EFF!
