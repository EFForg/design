# EFF STYLE GUIDE

## BRAND LOGOS
### History
![Primary EFF Logo image](EFF_primary_logo.jpg)

This is the EFF monogram! It's big, bold, and (in the extremely biased opinion of this designer who works with it all the time) a joy to use. It also has [a great backstory](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/effs-new-logo-member-shirt) involving a very niche Tumblr blog, disengenuous copyright claims, and a highly regarded design agency. 

### Variations + when to use what
The advantage to having an adaptable, modular logo is that it simply *works* across a variety of use cases. If you've ever tried in vain to squeeze a long logo into a narrow box, or a slim vertical logo into a wide box, you understand how nice it is to have a logo that can, as the kids say, do both. The downside is that a smorg√•sbord of variations creates some confusion re: deciding on the best option. Consider this a contextual guide to the many faces of our lovely logo. 

#### Monogram

The Monogram is just three bold letters. It should be used in either red or black. Here it is on a white background.
