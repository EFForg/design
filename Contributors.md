# Contributors Guide

Hello! Thank you for your interest in contributing to EFF's Open Source projects. 
We want to make sure you have all the information you need to make design decisions and craft a useful interface for our websites and extensions.

## How to contribute

Most of our contributors work directly on improving the UI and functionality of one of our Open Source products:

  * [Privacy Badger](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger)
  * [HTTPs Everywhere](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere)
  * [Certbot](https://github.com/certbot)
  * [STARTTLS Everywhere scanner](https://github.com/EFForg/starttls-frontend)
 
Normally you'll open a Pull Request for your changes in the product repo.

If you want to contribute with other EFF products or websites, we don't have specific guidelines for you right now, but we'll be developing those in the future.  

If you're looking for EFF's logos and brand guidelines, they're at [https://www.eff.org/press/logos](https://www.eff.org/press/logos)

Please file an issue on this repository if there's anything you'd like to see that is not covered here.

## Resources

We have a few resources to help you develop better interfaces for our projects. You will notice some of these are not implemented in the product yet, but we're working towards a unified style and we hope you help us out!

* Our product style guide
* Logos
* Fonts
* UI code fragments and examples
* Other files (wireframes, buttons, fields)

## Where to start

Here's a few issues where design contributors are needed:


## What to expect

When your contribution to a project involves a significant UI change, the project maintainers will often ask the EFF design team for input and feedback.
* It often takes us about two weeks to work on the issue and provide feedback. This can be much faster if your design is already using our guidelines and assets.
* If your design needs changes and/or we have suggestions, we will comment on your pull request (we'll be very nice!).
* If you have more general questions or a research proposal, please open an issue on this repo.

## What we're *not* looking for

* Complete redesigns of any of the apps or extensions
* Significant changes on how UI elements look or work
* Logo or branding changes

We appreciate your time! Please don't send us full color high definition mockups first, let's have a conversation with a few sketches before you suggest a very refined version of your idea.

## Contributing with user research

We love user research and we're often short on resources to user test everything we want.  We have prepared a specific guide if you want to help us with Research.  We'd appreciate it!
