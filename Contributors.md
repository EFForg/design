# Contributors Guide

Hello! Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Open Source projects. 
We want to make sure you have all the information you need to make design decisions and craft a useful interface for our websites and extensions.

## How to contribute

Most of our contributors work directly on improving the UI and functionality of one of our Open Source products:

  * Privacy Badger
  * HTTPs Everywhere
  * Certbot
  * STARTTLS Everywhere
 
If you want to contribute with other EFF products or websites, we don't have specific guidelines for you right now, but we'll be developing those in the future.  Please file an issue on this repository if there's anything you'd like to see that is not covered here.

## Resources (style guide and files)

We have a few resources to help you develop better interfaces for our projects. You will notice some of these are not implemented in the product yet, but we're working towards a unified style and we hope you help us out!

* Our product style guide
* Logos
* Fonts
* UI code fragments and examples
* Other files (wireframes, buttons, fields)
