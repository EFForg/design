# Research Guide
## So you want to do research
EFFâ€™s design team routinely incorporates usability and user tests into its process when developing standalone websites and extensions. Often EFF's design team is short on resources to user test everything we want. If you're interested in supporting our team in user testing our extensions, we'd love to collaborate.

### User testing
The EFF design team has various methods for conducting user tests, depending on the project. 
These include:
* In-person: At conferences, trainings, libraries, or with staffers, friends, or family.
* Online: [Userbrain](https://userbrain.net/), via social media

### Topic research projects
If you want to contribute topic research to EFF (not design or user research), check out our [Coding with EFF](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/volunteer/coding-with-eff) page where you can find the right way to get involved in a specific project. 

## Considerations and Constraints
### Privacy
EFF is a privacy organization, and we take the privacy of our user testing participants seriously. EFF is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website, as well as our members and volunteers. In general, EFF uses the information provided by users to further its mission, including to protect privacy, defend freedom and innovation, and to protect users' rights in the digital world. Keep this in mind when conducting user tests of your own. Here's some tips:
* Do not collect user information if you don't need it for your specific purpose
* Be extra-careful when handling user's personal information such as name, phone number, location and device identifiers.
* Do not share this information with third parties. 
* Make sure your research participants are properly informed about your project and that they consent to the information that will be shared with EFF. 

For more information, please read [EFF's privacy policy](https://www.eff.org/policy), as well as our [Privacy Policy for our Software and Technology Projects](https://www.eff.org/code/privacy/policy).

## How to
If you're new to user testing, or even if you've done it before, this article by the [Neilson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pm-research-plan/) is a good primer on all that's involved with user testing 

### Recruit users
Good news! You don't need to set up some elaborate test in order to conduct research. You really only need a small number of users to effectively test products. [This article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/) by the Nielson Norman Group tells you why.

Consider recruiting users at conferences, trainings, public events, or via social media. You can also use a service like [Userbrain](https://userbrain.net/) to find volunteers.

### Set goals
What are you trying to accomplish with your test? What specific features or flows are you testing? What insights do you hope to gain?

### Build a survey
### Build a script
### Create a paper prototype
### Observe a user interact with a device
### Format your feedback and conclusions

## Case Studies
### [Certbot](https://www.eff.org/wp/certbot-usability-case-study-making-it-easier-get-https-certificates%20)
This [case study](https://www.eff.org/wp/certbot-usability-case-study-making-it-easier-get-https-certificates%20) covers a year of internal user research and design strategy sessions with the goal of redesigning our Certbot website. Beyond securing the web, we hope this design case study will be helpful to other nonprofit organizations and independent groups who are also figuring out how to do smaller scale user research for their own technology projects.

## Contribute
* If you have a user testing research proposal, open an issue on the EFForg/design repo.
You should hear back from our team within two weeks, at which point we'll let you know if and when we can move forward with collaborating with you on your proposal.

### Here are a few things we are looking for help with
* Help us recruit user testers!
* User testing proposals for mobile on any of our extensions

### Here are a few things we are not looking to do at the moment
* A/B testing
* Very general tests or interviews (for example, on an entire browser extension)
