# Research Guide
## So you want to do research
EFFâ€™s design team routinely incorporates usability and user tests into its process when developing standalone websites and extensions. Often EFF's design team is short on resources to user test everything we want. If you're interested in supporting our team in user testing our extensions, we'd love to collaborate.
### User testing
The EFF design team has various methods for conducting user tests, depending on the project. 
These include:
* In-person: At conferences, trainings, libraries, or with staffers, friends, or family.
* Online: [Userbrain](https://userbrain.net/), via social media

### Issue research projects
If you want to contribute research to one of EFF's extensions, check out our [Coding with EFF](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/volunteer/coding-with-eff) page where you can find the right way to get involved in a specific project. 

## Considerations and Constraints
### Privacy
EFF is a privacy organization, and we take the privacy of our user testing participants seriously. EFF is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website, as well as our members and volunteers. In general, EFF uses the information provided by users to further its mission, including to protect privacy, defend freedom and innovation, and to protect users' rights in the digital world. Keep this in mind when conducting user tests of your own.

This [case study](https://www.eff.org/wp/certbot-usability-case-study-making-it-easier-get-https-certificates%20) covers a year of internal user research and design strategy sessions with the goal of redesigning our Certbot website. Beyond securing the web, we hope this design case study will be helpful to other nonprofit organizations and independent groups who are also figuring out how to do smaller scale user research for their own technology projects.

## Contribute
